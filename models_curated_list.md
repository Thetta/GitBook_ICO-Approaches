\(optional\) There is no requirement for a token launch. The token can be minted at any time just like in the "Continuous Token model" above.

“Curation Markets allows open source projects to earn from the work they collectively create. Curation is important in order to make decisions together. Any open source project can have an associated curation market attached it, helping it to make sure what pull requests should be merged and what features to consider.

A curation market is a smart contract on Ethereum that is deployed for a specific shared goal or topic that allows the minting of tokens set by a hard-coded algorithm. The cost \(in ETH\) to mint a token increases as the supply increases \(as more tokens are minted\). The cost decreases as the supply decreases \(tokens are withdrawn \(“burned”\) from supply\).

**Example:**

* **@1 000 supply, a token will cost: 0.01500809654 USD**
* **@5 000 000 supply, a token will cost: 41.31333111 USD**
* **@10 000 000 supply, a token will cost: 53242.33775 USD** 

The minted tokens are bonded to specific curators chosen by the token holders per sub-topic. Using their proportional standing in the curation community \(per topic\), these curators then back certain information \(equivalent to an “upvote”\). They can also revoke their backing.

Depending on the design: the ETH that is used to mint the tokens are either kept in a communal deposit, or split towards a trusted beneficiary. These design considerations are dependent on what the shared goal is.

A user can opt to voluntarily leave without selling on the secondary market. When leaving, a user can take a portion of the communal pool with them as reward. This reduces the supply and the subsequent cost to enter is also thus decreased”.
