**“You can invest in the Angel Token ICO knowing that there is an immutable Ethereum Smart Contract protecting the bulk of your Ethereum investment.

During the first 5 months you can be involved in the community and talk to the Founders, and see the initial investments and trades being made with the Ethereum raised, as well as benefit from any potential price increases of Angel Token as it gets listed on the exchanges.

If, for any reason during the first 5 months, you wish to no longer be involved, then as an ICO investor you can return your tokens. You will receive back up to 80% of the invested Ether amount, \(80% during the first 100 days and 40% during the next 50 days\).“
