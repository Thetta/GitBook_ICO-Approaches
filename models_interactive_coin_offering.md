“It’s an ICO purchase protocol, in which each individual contributor will choose an amount of tokens they’d like to purchase and a “Personal Cap”.

Personal Cap is the specified LIMIT of the total amount of ETH raised in the sale for a participant. If the total amount of ETH raised in the sale is more than the personal cap, the contributor will be removed from the sale or poked out”.
