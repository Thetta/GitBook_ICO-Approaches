### **Prohibited token transfers during or after the ICO**

“[I do NOT endorse locking](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/when-i-see-voting-games-i-usually-analyze-i-51-attacks-and-ii-bribe-attacks-looking-here-da7412a4a217) tokens to prevent trading. This is likely to just result in wrapper contracts, especially since we’ve seen a wrapper reverse dutch auction for Status already”.

**What happened?**

When the Status ICO was held and token transfers were prohibited, [some guy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5adce2c8e78ca9102af302eab5937f7cefb0a266#code) issued a smart contract that did an IOU to the public at a higher price. Buyers could claim the purchase first and could withdraw their tokens later when transfers became enabled by Status. This can be viewed as an “ICO inside an ICO”.

In the same way, any developer that has “vested” or “locked” tokens can issue IOUs with a lower/higher price. See an example of a so-called “Token Release Schedule” - [https://blog.aion.network/publicsaleupdate-fa92cff05aed](https://blog.aion.network/publicsaleupdate-fa92cff05aed)
