## Intro

Here at [Thetta.io](https://web.thetta.io) our goal is to protect all parties: investors, core team, community and our clients. We spent many days discussing and analyzing what options we have. So we came up with a list of different ICO options, approaches and models.

**Disclaimer: Please notice that the goal of this document is not to provide an orthogonal classification of different ICO options. Some/many properties of these approaches can be combined together. This document \(at least, in its current state\) should be considered as an unsorted list of different ICO approaches and options.**

### Your help is Greatly Appreciated and Welcome!

Feel free to update and fix.
