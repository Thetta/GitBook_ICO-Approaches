### **Microrounded Auction approach \(EOS\)**

EOS ICO has multiple rounds with fixed amount of tokens but unlimited amount of money raised. As a result, you won't know the valuation until the end of the round.

"ICO is divided into two phases, period 1 distributes 20% of EOS, period 2 distributes 70%. Phase 2 is split into 350 consecutive 23 hours periods, selling 2 mln. EOS tokens each period."
