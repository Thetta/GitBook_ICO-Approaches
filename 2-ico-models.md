## What is an "ICO approach**"?**

When discussing blockchains, the term “[protocol](https://blog.0xproject.com/the-difference-between-app-coins-and-protocol-tokens-7281a428348c)” is typically used to refer to the set of cryptoeconomic rules that maintain distributed consensus across a peer-to-peer network. In this sense of the term, there is one protocol per blockchain and one native token per protocol \(with a few exceptions\). However, blockchain consensus isn’t the only use case for cryptoeconomic protocols. More generally, cryptoeconomic protocols create financial incentives that drive a network of rational economic agents to coordinate their behavior towards the completion of a process.

#### Protocol -&gt; Model -&gt; Approach

We decided that "ICO Protocol" term is too strict.  
In many articles "ICO Model" term is used instead. However, we are using "Approach" in this document because this document is more about providing you with different real-world examples, then about strict classification. Remember, that many properties of these approaches can be combined together.
