### **Forecasting**

See [Wings](/wings.ai) as an example of this approach:

In addition to governance layer, the WINGS platform also provides a decentralized forecasting mechanism, enabling the token holders to estimate the probability of a certain event in the project life-cycle, such as:

* Amounts raised during the project crowd-sale period
* Certain milestone fulfillment \(for example, the probability of the project delivering a working prototype\)
* The price of the projectâ€™s tokens at a certain point in the future.

After the crowd sale has completed, the WINGS token owners are rewarded according to their forecasts. The project is switched into live projects area, with the chosen governance model becoming active. The project creator and the token owners are now able to submit new proposals regarding the project, and decide on them via the forecasting.

Forecasting does not affect the project ICO parameters.
