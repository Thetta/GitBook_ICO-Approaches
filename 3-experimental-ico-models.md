### 1** - Initial Free Offering \(**[**https://0xnil.org**](https://0xnil.org)**\)**

This approach is highly experimental.

“Tokens sold during an Initial Coin Offering \(ICO\) are usually backed by a service which pretends to guarantee that the token will increase its value. Against this claim, many recent ICOs have demonstrated that the declared value of a token is irrelevant for the market.

Having seen this, the thesis that 0xNIL wants to verify is:

Token's prices are arbitrary and depend on a perception of their value which has little to do with their declared value.

During the Initial Free Offering \(IFO\), those who send 0 ether to the contract address will receive some amount of NIL in exchange. To obtain more NIL, just send 0 ether again, and so on until the per-wallet limit is reached. This is an experiment and nobody can know if the NIL will be eventually traded. But if yes, any future earning will be a 100% gain.”

### 2** - Initial Bounty Offering \(**[**u.cash**](https://u.cash)**\)**

“An Initial Bounty Offering differs from the well-known Initial Coin Offering in that users can acquire tokens by completing bounties.”
