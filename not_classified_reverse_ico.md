“Companies undergo ‘Reverse IPOs’ as a simpler and quicker way of ‘going public’. A private company finds a typically underperforming public company and buys enough shares to control it. They then strip away everything but the organisational structure of the public company rendering it a shell, before completing a ‘share swap’ where shareholders in the private company swap their shares for shares in the shell company — rendering the private company public \(Example:[Burger King](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-burgerking-stock-idUSBRE85J0PW20120620%29)\).”
